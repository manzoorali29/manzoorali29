# Annual Performance and Achievements Report

## Introduction

This document provides an overview of my performance, achievements, and contributions over the past year. It highlights the projects I've been involved in, papers I have written, key accomplishments, challenges overcome, and skills developed.

## Overview of the Past Year

- **Projects**: Over the past year, I have actively contributed to three significant projects: **KISA**, **RELD**, and **SPARQL Embeddings**.
- **Responsibilities**: In the context of the KISA/KIAM project, my primary role was focused on the development aspect. I took full ownership of the RELD project, overseeing its entire lifecycle from conceptualization to successful implementation and eventual acceptance. Additionally, I played a pivotal role in the SPARQL Embeddings project, where my responsibility encompassed the thorough implementation of a transformer-based encoder.

## Achievements

### 1. Projects

#### Project A: KISA

- Effectively executed the implementation of its online API in advance of the projected timeline, leading to the creation of https://kisaa-ir.cs.upb.de/api/.
- Additionally, accomplished the training of a re-ranker for information retrieval.
- Currently, the project is progressing ahead of schedule.
- Collaborated closely with the KISA/KIAM team to optimize and enhance operational workflows.

#### Skill Development

- Gained proficiency in semantic search methodologies.
- Acquired knowledge of various techniques related to indexing:
    - Nearest Neighbor Search (ANN) employing FAISS, accessible at:  [https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss](https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss)
    - Proficiently utilized Elastic search for indexing purposes.
    - Applied Nearest Neighbor Search (ANN) using Annoy, available at: [https://github.com/spotify/annoy](https://github.com/spotify/annoy)
    - Employed Nearest Neighbor Search (ANN) through Hnswlib, accessible at: [https://github.com/nmslib/hnswlib/](https://github.com/nmslib/hnswlib/)
- Successfully completed a comprehensive information retrieval course on YouTube, aimed at deepening my understanding of the subject.
#### Project B: RELD
- Succefully completed the RELD (Relation Extraction Linked Data) project:
    - [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/dice-group/RELD)
    - [Documentation](https://manzoorali29.github.io/index.htm)
    - [Online](http://reld.cs.upb.de:8890/sparql)
    - [Paper](https://papers.dice-research.org/2023/RELD/public.pdf)
#### Skill Development
- Explored semantic web related technologies
- RDFLib library
- RDFize open-source relation extraction datasets
- Created a unified schema

#### Project C: SPARQL Embeddings
- My task was to implement a transformer based encoder for the already generated embeddings
- I have implemented the encoder
#### Skill Development
- Learns working in Pytorch
